# Likewise, when we store unicode objects make sure we don't write
# them with weird YAML tags indicating the Python data type. The
# standard string type is fine. We should do this:
# Dumper.add_representer(unicode, lambda dumper, value: dumper.represent_scalar(u'tag:yaml.org,2002:str', value))
#
# However, the standard PyYAML representer for strings does something
# weird: if a value cannot be parsed as an integer quotes are omitted.
#
# This is incredibly odd when the value is an integer with a leading
# zero. These values are typically parsed as octal integers, meaning
# quotes would normally be required (that's good). But when the value
# has an '8' or '9' in it, this would make it an invalid octal number
# and so quotes would no longer be required (that's confusing).
# We will override str and unicode output to choose the quotation
# style with our own logic. (According to PyYAML, style can be one of
# the empty string, ', ", |, or >, or None to, presumably, choose
# automatically.
